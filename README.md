<h2>About</h2>
Here is my finished project of the game. Not only did we have to redesign the game but log our steps in the proccess of designing i used trello to orginise the shedule and used it for notes and it was also great for keeping track of notes that were taken during meetings. 
The idea of the game it to move the crosshairs over the xenomorphs and facehuggers to destroy them but avoid the grenades. If a grenade is hit you loose a life once all three lives are lost its game over man.ive left a couple of screen shots below.
